# RestaurantApplication
In this project I have used Angular (for Front-end) and JSON-Server (for Back-end). CRUD operations are performed on restaurant. I have used reactive forms, validations on forms, routing, API calls using service, Header, Footer. Also JSON-Server is useful for back-end tasks (It is going to handle all GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations). Also added screenshots under ApplicationOverview folder to understand the basic working of application.


How to run this application ?
1. Install Node
2. Install npm
3. Install JSON-Server (For Details: https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
4. Install bootstrap (npm install --save bootstrap)
5. Clone this code
6. npm install
7. cd db/ and run json-server --watch db.json
8. cd restaurant/ and run ng serve
9. open browser and type http://localhost:4200
